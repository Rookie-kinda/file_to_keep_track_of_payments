# file_to_keep_track_of_payments
This is a code I created about 5 months ago, it is the first actually used program i create, it was made to update a simple excel sheet of people who payed a certain amount of money
iI will not include the excel sheet since it does include some sensitive data about real people, but feel free to tinker with the code
Feel free to contact me if there is anything you'd like to talk about, or if there is any suggestions you'd like to add, or, if it suites you moer, do a pull request if the thing is an edit in the code :D
